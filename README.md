# Multitier VPC

This module creates a simple VPC environment in a single region in 1 zone. It will create an example ACL for each subnet tier and can optionally create public gateways for each zone.

## VPC

This module creates a VPC in a single region inside a resource group.

Use IBM Cloud™ Virtual Private Cloud to create your own space in IBM Cloud™. A virtual private cloud (VPC) is a secure, isolated virtual network that combines the security of a private cloud with the availability and scalability of IBM's public cloud. <sup>[1](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-about-vpc)</sup>

### VPC Specific Variables

- `classic_access` - Can be `true` or `false`. 

- You can set up access from a VPC to your IBM Cloud classic infrastructure, including Direct Link connectivity. One VPC per region can communicate with classic resources.<sup>[2](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-about-vpc#about-classic-access)</sup>

## Subnets

This module creates a single tier of any of number of subnets in a single geographic zone in the region where the VPC was created. 

Each subnet consists of a specified IP address range (CIDR block). Subnets are bound to a single zone, and they cannot span multiple zones or regions. Subnets in the same VPC are connected to each other. <sup>[3](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-about-networking-for-vpc#subnets-in-the-vpc)</sup>

### Subnet Specific Variables

- `cidr_blocks` - List of IP ranges for this tier
        - A list of IP address ranges within the VPC where the subnet will be created. There must be a cidr block for each subnet created.
        - Cannot be a [reserved IP address](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-about-networking-for-vpc#reserved-ip-addresses)
        - If no CIDR blocks are provided, it will create subnets with 256 total ipv4 addresses.

- `acl_rules` - A list of ACL rules for all of the subnets in a single tier

## Public Gateway

This module can optionally create public gateways attached to the subnets.

A Public Gateway enables a subnet and all its attached virtual server instances to connect to the internet. Subnets are private by default. After a subnet is attached to the public gateway, all instances in that subnet can connect to the internet. Although each zone has only one public gateway, the public gateway can be attached to multiple subnets.<sup>[4](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-about-networking-for-vpc#public-gateway-for-external-connectivity)</sup>

## Access Control List

This module creates an ACL for each tier and attaches it to the subnets in that tier.

You can use an access control list (ACL) to control all incoming and outgoing traffic in IBM Cloud™ Virtual Private Cloud. An ACL is a built-in, virtual firewall, similar to a security group. In contrast to security groups, ACL rules control traffic to and from the subnets, rather than to and from the instances.<sup>[5](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-using-acls)
